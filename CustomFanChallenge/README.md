CustomFanChallenge - Solution Code
==================================

Defines custom attributes for the "on" and "off" colors for the dial
created in CustomFanController.

Introduction
------------

The app creates a circular UI element that resembles a physical fan control.
It uses a custom view that extends View to draw a circular fan control dial
with an indicator and text labels for the settings: 0 (off), 1 (low),
2 (medium), and 3 (high). When the user clicks the dial, it moves the
dial indicator to the next selection and changes the dial's color from
the "off" color to the "on" color for selections 1-3
(indicating that the fan power is on).
